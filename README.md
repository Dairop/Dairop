### I'm a French CS student that enjoy coding, mostly softwares and AI
I have different social media platforms about my projets cumulating a total of +200k views, mostly 
on YouTube and Scratch, a website to learn coding where you can also do more advanced projects if you don't fear doing a lot of optimization !

As you can see from my github C++ is my favorite language, but I enjoy all sort of projects and (almost) every language
