### I'm a CS student that enjoy coding, mostly softwares and AI.
I have different social media platforms about my projets cumulating a total of +200k views, mostly 
on YouTube and Scratch, a website to learn coding where you can also do more advanced projects if you don't fear doing a lot of optimization !

As you can see from my Github, C++ is my favorite language but I enjoy all sort of projects and (almost) every language.
I am also one of the founders of <a href="https://sportcooks.fr">Sportcooks</a>, a new cooking website for athletes.
